# Make web application progressive

## Description

Now-a-days, it is quite common that a business idea should be conceptualized in different types of applications such as web and mobile. It costs a lot of energy as you have to maintain the hosting of these applications separately. On the other hand, as internet speed is getting better everyday, developers and business people hardly think about the amount of data transmitted per user action from/to an application. It also costs a lot of energy because of the data transmitted over the network.

## Solution

From an energy efficiency perspective: 
1) avoiding multiple applications for browsers and native mobiles reduces the overall energy consumption for maintaining different hosting sites like Google Play Store, App Store, on-premise server etc.
2) enabling your application working fully in offline mode will also save the energy consumption significantly

A progressive web application (PWA) is a perfect match here! Progressive Web Apps can be developed independently, from scratch or by using ready-to-use solutions. Frameworks like [Vue Storefront](https://vuestorefront.io/), [PWA Studio](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio/), [Angular Service Worker](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-intro) or others can significantly reduce the time and costs of PWA implementation. 

## SCI Impact

`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`
[Software Carbon Intensity Spec](https://grnsft.org/sci)

Progressive web application will impact SCI as follows:

- `E`:  As a PWA is capable of working in offline mode, it will definitely save a lot of energy consumption by reducing the network communication. 
- `M`:  As a PWA eliminates the necessity of having multiple hosting servers for mobile and web applications, it will definitely reduce the embodied emissions by minimizing the hardware requirement.   

## Assumptions
- None 


## Considerations
- Learning curve for progressive web application development is big. Developers should have proper knowledge before starting a real PWA project. 
- PWA development may take significantly more time than a traditional web application, so business stakeholders should clearly understand the long term benefit of a PWA.
